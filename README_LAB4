Our names are Ben Elleman and Chris Barlas, and this program is a simulation of the disk-scheduling algorithem C-LOOK. This program works by
first randomly generating a number of secondary storage locations to be brought into memory at a given location, both of 
which are determined by define.h. These memory locations are then sorted via selection-sort parrallelization to find the manner in which 
they would be accessed via C-LOOK. To run the program, simply compile plab4 and run.
