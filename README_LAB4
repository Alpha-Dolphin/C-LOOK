Our names are Ben Elleman and Chris Barlas, and this program is a simulation of the disk-scheduling algorithem C-LOOK. This program works by
first randomly generating a number of secondary storage locations to be brought into memory as well as a disk head currently at given location,
both of which are determined by define.h. These cylinder locations are then sorted via selection-sort task-level parallelization to find the manner in 
which they would be accessed via C-LOOK. lab4 and lab4b are the two linear versions of the program that Ben originally worked on, while plab4 is the
version that implements parallelization which was the task of Chris. Please grade plab4. To run the program, simply compile plab4 with "make plab4" and run.
